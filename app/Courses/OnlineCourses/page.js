                  answer: "If you are not technically proficient OR comfortable using a computer to do an online course OR learn better in a classroom setting with a live instructor OR have a CDL, then please instead take the 8hr DIP course in our popular classroom setting! It is offered multiple times a week, at our many convenient Northern Virginia locations! TO VIEW SCHEDULE AND COMPLETE REGISTRATION, GO HERE: https://aadrivingacademy.net/drivers-improvement-program-virginia.html\n\n" +
                      "For the Online course, you must Register with AA Driving Academy FIRST – then you will register AGAIN with our affiliate vendor. The link will be sent to you after you have completed our registration process. We realize this is an extra step, however, it is necessary to ensure we have correct information so that we may issue you an accurate certificate of completion AND accurately report your course completion online to the VA DMV, thus reflecting on your VA driving record. Don’t worry, you will only pay once!\n\n" +
                      "**Your ‘Reason Code’ MUST be correct**\n" +
                      "If you enter the wrong reason code, it CANNOT be fixed at a later date. The VA DMV absolutely will NOT allow ANYONE to change this code! If you enter the wrong code, you may need to take the class again! It is YOUR responsibility to register correctly.\n\n" +
                      "If you received a letter with the VA DMV letterhead (logo at the top of the letter, Richmond address), then your ‘Reason Code’ should be (DMV) – NOT COURT ORDERED.\n\n" +
                      "If you are taking the course to get five (5) good points or at the request of a lawyer, prior to a court date, your reason code is Voluntary (VOL) – NOT COURT ORDERED.\n\n" +
                      "Only if you or your lawyer went to a court hearing and you were legally ordered by a judge or prosecutor to take this course in order to have your ticket dismissed or lowered, then your reason code should be COURT ORDERED (COU).\n\n" +
                      "You do NOT receive 5 good points if you choose the Insurance (INS) reason code.\n\n" +
                      "**There is NOTHING automatic about receiving the certificate of course completion**\n" +
                      "Once you have successfully completed the 8hr course and passed the final test, you do NOT instantly receive a certificate of completion! Please be patient.\n\n" +
                      "Depending on when you complete the course (day & time), please normally allow one (1) business day (Monday – Friday) to receive your certificate of completion via email.\n\n" +

                      "Do NOT wait until the last minute! Complete the course EARLY!\n\n" +

                      "VA DMV is NOT made aware of your completion until it is fully processed by our office – DMV is not set up for automatic notifications of any kind. It is a manual process.\n\n" +
                      "**AA Driving Academy does NOT communicate with courts or insurance companies**\n" +
                      "We will ONLY let the VA DMV know that you have completed the course. Any other institution that may require notification of your course completion will be 100% your SOLE responsibility.\n\n" +

    Please be aware that completion of the online program is not instantly processed. We are still required to notify DMV electronically that you have taken and passed the course. DMV is not set up for automatic notifications. This process takes at least 2 business days. This means that if you have a DMV deadline of 5/10/2021, completing the course at 11:50 pm on 5/9/2021 will NOT meet the deadline, and your license will be suspended. This is why DMV gives you 3 months to complete the course.

    <p style={{fontWeight:"700"}} className="text-base sm:text-lg mt-3">
    When you have completed the program and it has been fully processed, you will receive a certificate of completion via email, and we will notify DMV of your class completion. We do not notify courts or insurance companies under any circumstance. This is your responsibility.
