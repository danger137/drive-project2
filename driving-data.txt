The driving school’s 12-hour requirement is not offered as a single course on the website; instead, it is fulfilled by taking two separate classes: the 8-Hour DIP class and the 4-Hour Reckless/Aggressive Driving Program. Together, these form the complete 12-hour program mandated by the DMV. There is no prescribed order for taking these courses—you may choose to complete either first, although many opt for the 8-Hour DIP initially. Regarding meal provisions, the school does not provide lunch; however, a lunch break is scheduled around midday with the duration determined by the instructor. Since each location is centrally located with food options nearby, students who are unable to drive are advised to pack their own lunch. Additionally, while the online DIP program is available, its acceptance in court varies; some county courts and judges may require an in-person certificate. Therefore, if you need the DIP certificate for an upcoming court date, it’s wise to consult your attorney to confirm whether the online version will be accepted. Lastly, it is critical to adhere to the DMV’s instructions, as ignoring the DMV letter will result in an automatic suspension of your license on the specified date, with no exceptions or work-arounds permitted.


The re-examination program is designed with a strict structure to ensure that every student is thoroughly prepared to pass the DMV test. Regardless of how quickly you finish the assigned work, leaving early is not permitted, as the course is structured to simulate the actual test conditions and instill the discipline required for success at the DMV. Waiting until you turn 18 will not exempt you from taking the re-exam if you have already failed the test three times while underage—the requirement remains in effect regardless of your age. Additionally, the language options for the re-exam are limited; while the DMV provides the permit and knowledge tests in various languages, the re-exam itself is only available in English and Spanish. These measures ensure that every participant receives a consistent and rigorous preparation experience designed to meet the standards of the DMV.

In response to common queries regarding online and classroom Driver’s Education, it’s important to note that all students now have access to online Driver’s Education programs, regardless of whether they are home-schooled—a change from previous policies in the Commonwealth of Virginia. However, when it comes to the 90-Minute Parent/Teen Course, students residing in Planning District 8 (which includes Fairfax County, Loudoun County, Arlington County, Prince William County, and the cities of Alexandria, Fairfax, Falls Church, Manassas, and Manassas Park) are not permitted to take this course online, as neither the academy nor the DMV will accept an online certificate or the associated Parent/Teen video for those areas. Additionally, there is a common misconception that Driver’s Education is a prerequisite for obtaining a Learner’s Permit; in reality, no training is required before applying for a permit. Once a student reaches 15 years and 6 months of age, they can take the Learner’s Permit test, which is solely based on the Drivers Manual available at every DMV, dispelling the myth that formal Driver’s Education is necessary. Lastly, classroom materials are strictly confined to the academy’s premises and cannot be taken home; all required coursework must be completed on-site at designated locations such as Tysons or Herndon, ensuring that the structured learning environment is maintained throughout the course.

The Adult Waiver program is specifically designed for experienced drivers and is not intended for those who are new to driving. This program does not provide instruction on how to drive; rather, it serves adults who already possess at least 12 hours of driving practice and wish to bypass the 60-day waiting period required for new drivers. The 60-day period exists to ensure that individuals who do not have prior driving experience have ample time to develop the necessary skills to pass the DMV Road Test. Although the DMV informs adults over 18 about the existence of the Adult Waiver Program, it does not assess individual qualifications; that responsibility falls to experienced instructors who can readily determine if a student has sufficient driving practice. These instructors are highly skilled at recognizing inexperience and will not permit anyone to continue in the program if they lack the required proficiency. Additionally, it is important to understand that the Road Test administered by the academy is identical to the one given by the DMV; payment for the program does not influence the test’s difficulty or the outcome. Every candidate is expected to meet the same standards, ensuring that only those who are adequately prepared will pass the test.

The Courses section on the drive-project-gold website is meticulously organized using nested routing to provide a clear, in-depth look at every driving course available. The page categorizes each offering into distinct segments, making it simple for prospective students to navigate and find the exact training they need. It begins with the Drivers Improvement Program (DIP), offered in an 8-hour format available in both classroom and online settings, which is designed to reinforce safe driving habits and meet the DMV’s requirements. Complementing this is the 4-Hour Reckless/Aggressive Driving Course, specifically crafted to address and correct unsafe driving behaviors through focused, hands-on instruction. For individuals who have struggled with the DMV test, the site details the 8-Hour Drivers Manual/Reexamination Course, a program aimed at reorienting drivers with practical tips and thorough exam preparation after multiple failures. The Courses page also highlights specialized programs for younger drivers, including a comprehensive Teen Licensing Full Package Program that integrates both theoretical learning and practical behind-the-wheel training, as well as a 30-Hour Teen Driver’s Education Course available in an online, self-paced format for maximum flexibility. For experienced drivers seeking to expedite their licensing process, there is an Adult License Waiver Program that bypasses the standard waiting period while ensuring that all necessary qualifications are met. Each course listing is enriched with detailed descriptions covering curriculum outlines, course durations, scheduling options, prerequisites, and payment methods, all designed to help students make an informed choice. The nested routing approach ensures that whether a user is browsing general categories or diving into specific course details, they are presented with a seamless, user-friendly experience that underscores the institution's commitment to high-quality driver education.


The 8-Hour Driver Improvement Program (DIP) is a comprehensive, DMV-licensed course based on the National Safety Council’s Defensive Driving curriculum that offers a robust data set of information for anyone needing detailed answers about its structure and benefits. This program, available at 25 locations across Northern Virginia and offered multiple times each week, is designed to be both engaging and informative while covering critical topics such as defensive driving techniques, distracted and aggressive driving, traffic rules, and essential DMV guidelines. Participants can earn five good points on their driving record, which can help prevent license suspension, reinstate a suspended license, or even get tickets dismissed or reduced in traffic court, all while potentially lowering auto insurance premiums. The course is structured as a full eight hours of instruction (not counting breaks, with a scheduled lunch break included) and is available not only for regular drivers but also for CDL holders, with materials such as workbooks (including a Spanish version) provided to all attendees. At the conclusion of the session, students are required to take a multiple-choice test and, upon meeting the course requirements, receive a certificate of completion the same day—an essential document that must be carefully safeguarded since there is a $30 fee for reissuance. The program’s enrollment process offers both pre-registration online for $95—with steps including checking the DIP Calendar for upcoming schedules, completing the pre-registration form with a debit or credit card payment, receiving an email confirmation that must be printed out, and presenting this printed confirmation along with valid identification (driver’s license, learner’s permit, or DMV-issued ID, or a corresponding DMV letter if your license was taken away)—and walk-in registration on the day of the class for $110, payable only by cash or money order (as debit/credit cards and checks are not accepted in person). Additionally, on the day of class, it is crucial for participants to arrive at the scheduled start time (neither early to register nor late) and to present the required printed confirmation page, as showing the confirmation on a mobile device is insufficient, to ensure proper collection of payment evidence by the instructor. This detailed data set ensures that all aspects—from the curriculum content and schedule to enrollment requirements and post-course benefits—are thoroughly documented, allowing anyone reading it to answer any related questions with confidence.

The 8-Hour Online Driver Improvement Program (DIP) is a fully remote, DMV-licensed course designed to help participants earn five good points on their driving record while completing the entire course from the comfort of their home. Based on the same rigorous curriculum as the in-person class but optimized for an online format, the program is available to all ages—with the important exception that those holding a Commercial Driver’s License (CDL) must attend in person. Students who opt for the online version benefit from a flexible, 100% virtual learning environment that includes a comprehensive curriculum on defensive driving techniques, traffic rules, and practical strategies for avoiding distractions and aggressive driving behaviors. Upon registration with AA Driving Academy, participants will complete a two-step process where, after the initial enrollment and payment of an $80 fee online, they receive a subsequent link from an affiliate vendor to access the course materials and final examination. It is critical to understand that completion of the online course is not processed instantly; instead, once you pass the final test, there is a manual process that takes up to two business days to notify the Virginia DMV of your course completion. This delay is crucial to note, especially if you have a looming DMV deadline, as your license could be suspended if the processing window is not met. Furthermore, the program emphasizes the importance of accurate registration, specifically regarding the ‘Reason Code’—a detail that determines whether you will earn the five good points on your record and must be entered correctly to avoid having to retake the course. Once all processing is complete, you will receive your certificate of completion via email, which serves as your proof of having met all requirements; however, it is your sole responsibility to forward this certificate to any courts, insurance companies, or legal representatives as AA Driving Academy only reports completion to the DMV. This detailed dataset encompasses every facet of the online DIP course—from registration nuances, payment procedures, and technical requirements, to the timeline for processing course completion—ensuring that anyone reading it can confidently address any questions related to the structure, requirements, and benefits of the program.

The 4-Hour Reckless/Aggressive Driver Course, offered at our Herndon, VA office, is a specialized program designed to address the serious and far-reaching consequences of receiving a reckless driving ticket in Virginia—a class 1 misdemeanor that carries heavy penalties including demerit points, potential jail time, driver’s license suspension, steep fines, and a lasting impact on your criminal record and insurance premiums. This course is highly recommended for individuals facing such charges, particularly when accompanied by the 8-hour DIP course, as it provides not only an in-depth exploration of the causes and psychological aspects behind reckless and aggressive driving but also practical strategies to avoid dangerous driving situations and navigate everyday traffic challenges safely. During the four hours of participation-based instruction—where no final test is administered—the course covers a comprehensive array of topics including traffic court preparation, coaching, and guidance, thereby equipping students with the skills and confidence needed to present a well-prepared case in court and potentially secure a reduction in penalties, prevent license suspension, or even have their auto insurance premiums lowered. Enrollment options include pre-registration for $95, where students must complete an online form, receive and print a confirmation page, and present it alongside a valid driver’s license, learner’s permit, or DMV-issued ID at the start of class; alternatively, walk-in registration is available on the day of the class for $110, payable only by cash or money order, with strict instructions to arrive at the designated start time without being too early or late to ensure smooth processing. All necessary course work, class supplies, and a participation certificate—issued on the same day—are provided, and it is emphasized that students safeguard their certificates since reissuance incurs a fee and the certificate must ultimately be presented to the court, attorney, or judge as proof of completion. Since AA Driving Academy opened its doors in 1994, it has remained committed to teaching safe, responsible, and accountable driving by educating over 80,000 student drivers, and for those dealing with the legal ramifications of a reckless driving charge, additional legal resources and attorney information are available to help guide them through the complex landscape of Virginia’s traffic laws and court procedures.
YSSR Education's Driver’s Manual/Reexamination Course is a comprehensive, tailored program created specifically for driver's license applicants who have failed the DMV knowledge exam or road skills test three times, serving as a critical prerequisite for a fourth testing attempt. Offered multiple times a week at two convenient locations in Northern Virginia, including our Herndon office at 1043 Sterling Rd, #101, Herndon, VA 20170, this mandatory course ensures that all participants—regardless of age, as even those who have reached 18 without passing are required to attend—are thoroughly prepared to meet DMV standards. The course provides an in-depth review of essential driving concepts as outlined in the driver's manual, reinforcing the knowledge and skills necessary for safe and responsible driving while addressing the common pitfalls that have previously led to test failures. Upon successful completion of the course, participants are issued a Reexamination Certificate (DTS-C) on the same day, a crucial document that must be presented to the DMV for another chance at the exam. With flexible scheduling options available, including full 8-hour sessions and select shorter sessions, the program is designed to fit various schedules, ensuring maximum accessibility for all applicants. Please note that due to current circumstances, the schedule may be subject to change, so it is advised to contact our office the day before your intended class date to confirm your session. Through this rigorous and supportive educational approach, YSSR Education’s Driver’s Manual/Reexamination Course not only helps overcome previous setbacks but also instills a deep understanding of key driving principles, ultimately empowering you to confidently pursue your learner’s permit or driver’s license in Virginia.

YSSR Education offers a comprehensive suite of reexamination options meticulously designed for individuals who have encountered multiple setbacks at the DMV. Option 1, the 8-Hour Driver’s Manual/Reexamination Course, is specifically tailored for adults aged 18 or older and teens under 18 who have already completed Driver’s Ed, particularly those with three knowledge test failures. This intensive eight-hour course, grounded in the Virginia Drivers Manual, is structured to reinforce critical driving concepts and prepare you thoroughly for the knowledge test; upon successful completion, you will receive a Reexamination Certificate (DTS-C) on the same day, allowing you to immediately return to the DMV for a fourth—and indeed unlimited—test attempt until you pass. For teens under 18 who have not yet completed Driver’s Ed, Option 2 presents two distinct pathways: Option 2a, which combines 30 Hours of Online Driver’s Education with a 90-minute Parent/Teen Course, and Option 2b, which offers 30 Hours of Classroom Driver’s Education paired with the same 90-minute Parent/Teen Course. Both are essential for those who have failed the knowledge test three times and are designed to provide the in-depth instruction necessary to secure a successful outcome on subsequent DMV retakes. Meanwhile, Option 3 caters to those who have failed the DMV Road Test three times by offering 7 Hours of Behind-the-Wheel training—comprising seven 50-minute in-car driving sessions—that delivers the practical, real-world driving experience required to build confidence and competence behind the wheel. The reexamination program at YSSR Education deviates from the traditional lecture format, emphasizing a flexible, rolling enrollment model held exclusively in Herndon that accommodates various schedules with sessions available on weekday mornings, evenings, and weekends, all while supplying every class material you need. Upon completion of any course, a Reexamination Certificate (DTS-C) is issued immediately, granting you the freedom to retake your exam at the DMV as many times as necessary until you pass; should you require further assistance, you can return to our program for additional help at no extra charge. Enrollment fees are competitively set at $199 for Option 1, $200 for Option 2a, $265 for Option 2b, and $325 for Option 3. Every class is taught by DMV-certified instructors—many of whom are active or retired law enforcement officers with extensive expertise in traffic law enforcement, emergency driving, collision investigation, and traffic court procedures—who undergo rigorous annual FBI background checks and DMV driving record audits, ensuring you receive top-notch instruction from professionals committed to safe, responsible, and accountable driving. Since its inception in 1994, YSSR Education has empowered over 80,000 student drivers, and on the day of your class, you are required to arrive precisely at the scheduled start time (without arriving 15 minutes early or late) and bring a printed Confirmation Page from your pre-registration form, a printed PayPal payment receipt (if applicable, or cash/money order as checks are not accepted), a completed and signed school contract (if under 18, signed by both the student and a parent or guardian), and a valid form of identification (such as a DMV-issued ID, federal ID, passport, or birth certificate); additionally, students under 18 taking the 8-hour course must provide the original certificate of completion (DEC-1) from their Driver’s Ed. This robust, detail-oriented reexamination program not only furnishes you with the essential academic and practical tools to successfully retake and pass your DMV exams but also ensures that you are fully prepared to obtain your Learner’s Permit or driver’s license with confidence.

Sign up and take the course at the convenience of your own house at any time, with the flexibility to study at your own pace and schedule, while receiving all the essential materials and guidance you need to succeed.

Upon completion of the course, you will be issued the Re-Examination Certificate via e-mail within 24-48 business hours, allowing you to immediately return to the DMV and retake the knowledge test as many times as necessary until you pass, ensuring that you can finally obtain your Learner’s Permit or Driver’s License in Virginia. It is important to note that this requirement to obtain the certificate of completion applies regardless of age, meaning that even minors are required to complete this course and cannot bypass this step by merely reaching 18 years of age. For those who meet the criteria, we offer several options to accommodate different needs and preferences. Option 1 is the 8-Hours Driver’s Manual/Reexamination Course, specifically designed for adults aged 18 or over and for teens under age 18 who have already completed Driver’s Ed.

Option 2a is the 30 Hours Online Driver’s Education coupled with a 90-minute Parent/Teen Course, designed for teens under age 18 who have not completed Drivers Ed in school; this option ensures that if you have failed the knowledge test three times, you receive comprehensive instruction through a full 30-hour curriculum plus an essential 90-minute Parent-Teen session. Alternatively, Option 2b offers the 30 Hours Classroom Driver’s Education along with the same 90-minute Parent/Teen Course, providing a traditional in-person learning environment for those who prefer face-to-face instruction, while still covering all the necessary material for success on your next DMV test.

Our approach is designed to equip you with not only the knowledge required to pass your DMV exam but also the practical skills and confidence needed for safe driving.

Explore our Adult License Waiver Program—a comprehensive, two-part course specifically designed for adults aged 18 and over who hold a valid Learner’s Permit issued by the Virginia DMV and wish to waive the mandatory 60-day holding period while bypassing the final road test at a DMV location. This innovative program is perfect for drivers who already have a minimum of 12 hours of driving practice under their belt and are not brand new behind the wheel. In Part 1, you will complete a self-paced online Driver’s Education course that meets the state’s 30-hour requirement and is available around the clock, allowing you to study at your convenience. Once you finish the online coursework, you must schedule your final exam at our Herndon office, where a DMV-certified instructor will administer the exam in person. Part 2 of the program involves behind-the-wheel training that comprises 14 periods of in‑car instruction divided into seven sessions, each lasting 1 hour and 40 minutes—50 minutes of active driving followed by 50 minutes of observational learning. During the final session, if you demonstrate proficient driving skills, our instructor will pass you on the spot, thereby exempting you from taking the final road test at a DMV center. Please note that this program is not available for individuals who have failed the road test three times; they must enroll in the Road Test Reexamination course instead.

Explore our Adult License Waiver Program—a comprehensive, two-part course specifically designed for adults aged 18 and over who hold a valid Learner’s Permit issued by the Virginia DMV and wish to waive the mandatory 60-day holding period while bypassing the final road test at a DMV location. This innovative program is meticulously crafted for drivers who have already accumulated at least 12 hours of driving practice and are not complete beginners, ensuring that you have a solid foundation of real-world experience before embarking on this advanced training pathway. In Part 1, you will begin with a self-paced online Driver’s Education course that meets the state-mandated 30-hour requirement and is accessible 24/7, allowing you to study at your convenience—whether early in the morning, late at night, or during breaks in your busy schedule.
